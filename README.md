## ABOUT

A quick workshop on how Nodemon works, and how to create your own simple version!

## WHAT WE WILL DO:

- explain what is nodemon
- explain what can you do with your own version
- how to make `downloads-checker.sh`
- how to make `history-to-webhook.sh`
- showcase my own project where I am using it as well (https://github.com/CCleanerShot/cc-react)

_The webhook will be deleted by next week. Feel free to abuse it while you can._
